# Custom Moon: Bomenoren

**Welcome, valued employees.**

>Your next assignment takes you to the forest moon A-97X, code name: Bomenoren. A lush and sprawling wilderness. This moon's dense foliage creates a challenging environment where every step could be your last.

>Beware, the dogs here are unlike any you've encountered before. Their numbers are greater, and their presence more menacing. The forest is littered with fallen branches and rustling bushes that will betray your movements with the slightest touch. In this moon's eerie silence, even the faintest noise will draw their attention.

>Remain vigilant. The forest's secrets are yours to uncover, but only if you can survive its lurking dangers. Proceed with caution, scavenger. The shadows are alive with unseen threats.

## Good luck, the company awaits your return.

### Details
Bomenoren is a vanilla-style moon, it's meant to integrate naturally with the aesthetic of the base game, but at the same time it aims to provide an experience unique from it, too.

Also, a new piece of scrap found in the facility on this moon may remind you of your foe, perhaps you can take it as a souvenir.
